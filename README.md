# Summary
This repo contains work involved in comparing COVID Tracking Project data to the CDC COVID tracker data.

## Data
We are using CDC data current to 3pm EST 5/16, saved to https://github.com/covidtrackingproject/cdc-comparison/blob/master/cdc.csv.
Note that the freshness of testing data differs from that of the cases/deaths data:
- Testing data timestamp: May 13 2020 12:00AM
- Positives/deaths data timestamp: May 16 2020 5:45PM.

For that reason, we compare the CDC testing data to CTP data published on May 14 (which reflects May 13). For the positives/deaths 
data comparison, we use CTP data published on May 16.
